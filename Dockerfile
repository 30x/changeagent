# Run changeagent in a container
#
# Example:
#
# Optionally, create a directory on your docker host so that the data can be persistently stored:
#
#   mkdir ~/agent/data1
#
# Now run:
#
# docker run -it -p 8080:8080 \
#   -v /home/docker/agent/data1:/data changeagent
#
# Image details:
#
# Changeagent will listen on port 8080. Map it however you want.
#
# When it first starts, changeagent will be running in standalone mode.
# To assemble a group of changeagent servers into a cluster, see the README.
#
# Each agent will store its database in /data. Since data is important,
# this should be a persistent volume.
# (If you choose not to create this directory, then the data will be stored
# on the ephemeral volume created by Docker, and will go away when the
# container is stopped.)

# This image has Git, Glide, and rocksdb pre-built for us.
